						<td><u><b>Course Goals:</b></u> The Chinese Learning Program accepts children from 4 to 6 years old. The aim is to help students learn correct pronunciation, rhythm, and dialogue through the interesting and easily memorized materials, to learn key vocabulary words and expressions for daily activities, such as greeting, eating and shopping. With one to two years of learning in pre-K or kindergarten, students will develop a solid foundation for further Chinese study.  </td>
